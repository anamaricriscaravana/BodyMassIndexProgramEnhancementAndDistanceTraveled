# Body Mass Index Program Enhancement and Distance Traveled
This project is developed for a Programming Logic and Design subject, that involves creating programs in Java, Python, and C++ to solve specific problems. The exercises focus on applying fundamental programming concepts such as modular design, input handling, calculations, output formatting, and control structures.

# Problems
1. Body Mass Index (BMI) Program Enhancement

- Description: Enhance a previously designed program that calculates a person’s Body Mass Index (BMI). The program now includes functionality to display a message indicating whether the person has an optimal weight, is underweight, or is overweight based on their BMI.
- Formula: BMI = (Weight × 703) / (Height^2)
- Weight Categories:
   <br/> **Optimal weight:** BMI between 18.5 and 25
   <br/> **Underweight:** BMI less than 18.5
   <br/> **Overweight:** BMI greater than 25

2. Distance Traveled

- Description: Design a program that calculates and displays the distance a vehicle travels over time. The program asks the user for the speed of the vehicle (in miles per hour) and the number of hours it has traveled. It then uses a loop to display the distance traveled for each hour of the specified time period.
- Formula: Distance = Speed × Time
